# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of bike-share usage data from Cyclistic, a bike-share company operating in Chicago. The goal of the analysis is to understand the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members and to develop a data-driven marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Business Task

The business task involves the following objectives:
- Analyze usage differences between casual riders and annual members.
- Devise a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
- Provide recommendations backed by compelling data insights and visualizations.

## Data Sources

The analysis utilizes the following data sources:
- Cyclistic Bike Usage Data: Contains information about bike rides taken by casual riders and annual members, including ride duration, start and end locations, timestamps, bike ID, and user type.
- User Demographic Data: Provides demographic information about Cyclistic users, such as age, gender, income level, and location.
- Membership Data: Includes data on Cyclistic membership status, start date of membership, renewal status, and membership type (annual or casual).

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. Tailor Membership Options: Introduce flexible membership plans with benefits such as an "Unlimited Ride Pass" to accommodate the longer rides preferred by casual riders.
2. Weekly Promotions: Offer "Thursdays Only" discounts on annual memberships to capitalize on casual riders' high cycling activity on Thursdays and incentivize them to commit to annual memberships.
3. Personalized Bike Options: Provide annual members with the choice between docked bikes and classic bikes to align with casual riders' preferences and enhance the appeal of annual memberships with personalized bike options.

## Conclusion

By implementing these recommendations, Cyclistic can effectively target casual riders and encourage them to purchase annual memberships, thereby maximizing annual memberships and ensuring future success.
